        <h2>Program Description</h2>
        <p>
          Do you want to know how to design and program the computers powering
          some of today’s greatest innovations? <br />

          Ever wondered how your phone knows where the nearest Starbucks is,
          how Google’s self-driving car is even possible, or how your music
          and photos live in the cloud? <br />
          <br />
          Maybe you want to know how computers protect businesses — and people
          — and other cybersecurity issues. <br />
          AUM’s Computer Science Program, with a curriculum based on the
          latest ACM/IEEE recommendations and an emphasis on high-performance
          computing, will prepare you for a career in computer programming,
          networking, database management, multimedia design or technology
          architecture.
